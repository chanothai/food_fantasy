    <string name="test_describe_food">There have been many claims about the origin of the hamburger,
        but the origins remain unclear.The popular book "The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy" by Hannah Glasse included a recipe in 1758 as "Hamburgh sausage",
        which suggested to serve it "roasted with toasted bread under it".
        A similar snack was also popular in Hamburg by the name "Rundstück warm" ("bread roll warm") in 1869 or earlier,
        and supposedly eaten by many emigrants on their way to America, but may have contained roasted beefsteak rather than Frikadeller.
        Hamburg steak is reported to have been served between two pieces of bread on the Hamburg America Line, which began operations in 1847.
        Each of these may mark the invention of the Hamburger, and explain the name. Hamburger Hamburger (black bg).jpg Course	Main coursePlace of origin	Germany (disputed)Created by Multiple claims (see text)
